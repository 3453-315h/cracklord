# This configuration file manages the direct connect resource manager.  Due to 
# the nature of the resource manager, it is fairly simple and does not require
# complex settings. 

# The hosts section includes a listing of hosts that the system should attempt
# to make a connection to upon startup.  This section is entirely optional and 
# can be commented out with no issues. No matter what is here, you can still
# add hosts through the API and Web GUI.  Each host should be in the format: 
#    address=name
# 
# [Hosts]
# localhost=Local Resource
